# Android: a single arm64-only APK. `--target-platform android-arm64` keeps
# Flutter from compiling the other ABIs at all, and `abiFilters` in
# android/app/build.gradle is the backstop so even a plain `flutter build apk`
# cannot ship 32-bit.
#
# iOS: an **unsigned** .ipa for sideloading (AltStore / Sideloadly / your own
# provisioning profile). There is no Apple Developer account behind this app,
# so there is nothing to sign with here and nothing to submit to; the archive
# is built with --no-codesign and packaged by hand. Whoever installs it signs
# it with their own identity.
#
# Things this exists to get right, because all of them have already bitten us:
#
#   1. JDK version. AGP's bundled lint calls java.util.List.removeLast(), which
#      only exists on JDK 21+. Building on JDK 17 fails deep inside lint with a
#      NoSuchMethodError that says nothing about Java versions.
#   2. Symbol files. --obfuscate renames every identifier, so a crash from a
#      shipped build is unreadable without the matching .symbols file. They are
#      written to symbols/<version>/ and MUST be kept for as long as that
#      version is in anyone's hands. Attach them to the GitHub release.
#   3. iOS has no CocoaPods. Every plugin this app uses ships a Package.swift,
#      so the project is integrated through Swift Package Manager and there is
#      deliberately no ios/Podfile. Do not re-add one to "fix" a build; if a
#      future plugin is Pods-only, regenerate it with `flutter create .` and
#      say so here.
